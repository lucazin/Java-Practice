    /*
 Given a non-empty array of integers arr, create a function that returns the index of a peak element.
  We consider an element as peak if it's greater than or equal to its neighbors,
   the next and previous element (assume that arr[-1] and arr[n] are equal to -âˆž). 
   And if there are multiple peaks in arr, just return the index of one of them.

Example 1:

Input: arr = [4, 5, 8, 3]

Output: 2

Explanation: arr[2] is a peak element because it's greater than or equal to arr[1], and greater than or equal to arr[3]
